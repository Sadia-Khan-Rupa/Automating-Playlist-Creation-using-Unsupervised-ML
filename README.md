## Project Structure

### 1. Naming the Clusters
File: `Cluster_Naming.ipynb`  
This notebook focuses on analyzing clusters obtained through machine learning techniques, specifically exploring how to interpret and name clusters effectively.

### 2. Challenge 5: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
File: `Challenge_5.ipynb`  
This notebook applies PCA to reduce noise and dimensionality in the Spotify dataset. By identifying the most critical features, the process aids in efficient clustering of songs. The analysis explores clusters based on features such as genre, tempo, and mood.

### 3. Challenge 3: Clustering with K-Means
File: `Challenge_3.ipynb`  
This notebook dives into clustering the Spotify dataset using K-Means. Key highlights include:
- Adding cluster assignments to the dataset.
- Performing centroid analysis to interpret clusters.
- Visualizing clusters using radar charts for deeper insights.

### 4. Challenge 2: Scalers and Transformers
File: `Challeneg 2.ipynb`  
This notebook experiments with different scalers and transformers on the Spotify dataset. The goal is to compare their impacts on data preprocessing and identify which scaling techniques yield the best results.
